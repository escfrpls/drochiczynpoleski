The reason for the construction was the event of 1936. When in an ordinary rural family living in the village of Zarzeczka, the mistress of the house began to observe that the old family icon of Our Lady of Kazan surprisingly brightened and began to be renewed. The icon began to emit a quiet bell ringing, which was heard for two months. A commission from the then Pinsk Monastery witnessed this miraculous phenomenon.
