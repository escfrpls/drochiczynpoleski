The village is mentioned at the end of the 15th and in the first half of the 16th century as part of the Zditowo volost, Troki Voivodeship, Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1494, it is mentioned in a letter from Grand Duke Aleksander of Lithuania, which confirms the rights of the Andrejewicz family to own their estates in the Pinsk Principality. In 1580, the estate belonged to Mihail Bogowitowicz-Kozieradski, and in 1596, it was purchased by Bishop Kirill Terlecki, a well-known figure of the Union of Brest. Administratively, Perkowicze belonged to the Brest Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Until the middle of the 17th century, it was part of the Braszewicze Key in the Pinsk County, Brest County, Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From 1791, it was part of the Kobryn County. In 1756, the Perkowicze estate became the property of the Wyslouch family, who owned it for almost two centuries, until 1939.

From 1795, it was part of the Russian Empire, in the Kobryn district, Slonim district, from 1797 in the Lithuanian province, and from 1801 in the Grodno province. In 1805, Zenon Wyslouch, the deputy governor of Brest, built a noble estate in Perkowicze. He also built a stone Assumption Church in the late classicist style on the estate.

Later, the estate was owned by Felix Wyslouch, who was the military commissioner of the Wilno Governorate during the 1863 uprising. During the 1863-64 uprising, the estate served as a weapons depot for the rebels. The RGIA archives contain a record about our village, F. 577 Op. 10 D. 222, dates: October 23, 1864 - December 16, 1869. From this, we can see that part of the Perkowicze lands belonged to the landowner Nosarzewski.

In 1865, a public school was opened. The estate passed from Felix Wyslouch to his son Anthony, who was known as a historian, collector, and bibliophile. In 1906, Antoni rebuilt the manor house. At the beginning of the 20th century, the estate was surrounded by a park covering an area of up to 16 hectares. Antoni Wyslouch had nine children: Franciszek became a well-known writer and author of books about Polesie; Severin became a professor of history; and Stanislaw was the last owner of the family estate (1930–1939), moving to Warsaw after these lands were transferred to the USSR. Old Anthony Perkowicze was arrested by the Soviet authorities and deported deep into Russia, where he died. In the 1860s, Perkowicze (the center of the village of Krawce), then in the Wolowiel volost, Kobryn district, Grodno province. At the beginning of the 19th century, a manor was built in the eastern part, which consisted of a two-story house, a church, a landscape park, and artificial reservoirs. In the “Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Countries, Volume XV, Part 2,” there is a fairly standard description of our village in terms of territory, but there is also a record that the local church has a tombstone of Kirill Terlecki, this information is for 1880-1914.

In 1905, the Perkowicze parish had 5 residents; the Perkowicze estate had 55 residents. There was an elementary school in the parish. In 1907, an exchange took place between the local church and the peasants, as confirmed by an entry in the Russian State Historical Archives, F. 796 Op. 188 D. 3253:
