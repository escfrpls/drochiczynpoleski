It is very likely that the village of Koty is derived from the village of Raszyn, or rather New Raszyn. It could be in case of selling the village, or renaming the village.

From Schubert's map of 1826-1840, we can see on the map the village Raszyn (us Raszyn), and its lower part coincides with today's village Koty.

On the military topographical map of the Russian Empire for the years 1846-1863 we can already see New and Old Raszyn. New Raszyn is just our future Koty.
