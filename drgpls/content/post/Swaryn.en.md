Svarin is mentioned in the 16th century as a village called Swaryczewicze in the Pinsk district of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1531, it was mentioned in a deed of gift to Queen Bona. In “Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Countries,” volume 12, there is information about the Uperinets tract, taken from the 16th-century book “Revision of Pushch,” published by Wil.
