Svarin is mentioned in the 16th century as a village called Swaryczewicze in the Pinsk district of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1531, it was mentioned in a deed of gift to Queen Bona. In “Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Countries,” volume 12, there is information about the Uperinets tract, taken from the 16th-century book “Revision of Pushch,” published by Wil. Arch. Kom., 10-11.

It was located in the former royal forest, Pinsk County. Not far from the villages of Swaryczew and Swaryczewicze. In 1880, it was located in the municipality of Raczysk? (this information should be verified, as it may refer to a different location).

From 1795, it was part of the Russian Empire, in the Kobryn district of Slonim, from 1797 in Lithuania, and from 1801 in the Grodno province. The village on Schubert's map from 1826-1840:
