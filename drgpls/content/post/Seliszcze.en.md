 The Russian State Historical Archive has a record about the village of Seliszcze. F. 379 Op. 4 D. 352, dates: May 4, 1814 - June 26, 1814:

> Case concerning the allocation of land to peasants in the village of Seliszcze.

This fund contains information about state forests, forestry, and a description of landowners' lands in the Western Region. It is possible that this record refers to our village. This would be logical, since many settlements appeared thanks to the Dnieper-Bug Canal. However, we can only be 100% sure if we check the documents on site in the archive.
