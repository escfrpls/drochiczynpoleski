It is also worth mentioning the Uniate priest at Wolowel Church:

In the 1840s, St. George's Church was given to the Orthodox.
In 1865-1866 the church was moved to the center of the village of Wolowiel, and it was renovated.

Earlier Wolowiel church was located on the tract of land Pobedyshche (in the local Pole or what to call in another Tuteisham language), later (2nd half of the 19th century) because of the fact that the farms of Wolowiel village shrank it was on the outskirts of the village and it was decided by the parishioners to move it to the center of Wolowiel village. And to this day it is still there. And on the place where the old church stood there was a spring for a long time.
