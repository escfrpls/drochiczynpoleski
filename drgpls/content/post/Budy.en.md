The village Bobki already existed as a settlement in 1826-1840, signed by the village of Lady *Budy (probably a neighboring village, from which one of the settlements appeared later), which is confirmed by Schubert's maps for this time:



In 1921 - 39. It was part of Poland, a village in Ilovsky Commune, Drohiczyn District, Pinsk Voivodeship. The village had 6 courtyards, 26 inhabitants.
