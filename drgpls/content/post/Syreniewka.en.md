The village was established in 1960 during the liquidation of farmsteads and other small settlements. The first settlers were residents of the Rowiny colony (in 1959 in the Starosielsk village council). In 1970, there were 183 residents in the Drohiczyn village council. In 1995, there were 86 households and 251 residents.
