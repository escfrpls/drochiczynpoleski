On Schubert's map from 1826-1840, we can see that “Adamowo” is mentioned in the place of our village. It is quite possible that this estate was sold in the future, and over time, Puchowa absorbed this part of the village of Adamowo.

The village is mentioned in 1858 as an estate in the Osowiec volost, Kobryn povet, Grodno province. It belonged to Julia Klimoszewska. In 1905, eight people lived on the estate.

It is also worth noting that on the 1/2 map, a clear division between the Adamowo estate and the Puchowa farmstead can be seen at that time.
